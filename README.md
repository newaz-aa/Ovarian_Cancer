## Synopsis

This work reflects the application of AI in medical diagnosis and the transparency that is required for a reliable decision-support tool.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in women. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for the survival of the patients. However, the majority of women are diagnosed in advanced stages due to the lack of effective biomarkers and accurate screening tools. While previous studies sought a common biomarker, our study suggests different biomarkers for the premenopausal and postmenopausal populations. This can provide a new perspective in the search for novel predictors for the effective diagnosis of OC. 

The stochastic nature of the ML algorithms as well as feature selection techniques raises concerns about the reliability of the system. To increase the trustworthiness and accountability of the diagnostic system as well as to provide transparency and explanations behind the predictions, explainable AI (XAI) has been incorporated into the ML framework. 

The diagnostic accuracy obtained from the proposed system outperforms the existing methods as well as the state-of-the-art ROMA algorithm by a substantial margin.
